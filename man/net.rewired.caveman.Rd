\title{Rewired (Connected) Caveman Network}
\usage{
net.rewired.caveman(nc, m, p)
}
\arguments{
\item{nc}{Number of cliques (or caves) in the network.}

\item{m}{Number of nodes per clique.}

\item{p}{Link rewiring probability.}
}
\value{
A list containing the nodes of the network and their respective neighbors.
}
\description{
Simulate a rewired caveman network of m cliques of size k, and with a link rewiring probability p.
}
\details{
The rewired caveman network is built on the corresponding regular caveman network with m cliques of size k. Then the links in this caveman network are rewired with probability p.
